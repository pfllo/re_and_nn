\section{The Task}
\subsection{Problem Definition}
Intent detection is a typical sentence classification task.
We need to learn a mapping function that maps an input sentence $\textbf{x}$, where $\textbf{x}=[x_{1}, ..., x_{n}]$ is the input sentence with $n$ words, to the corresponding intent $y$.
% $f: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$
% Given a set of training examples $\{(x_i, y_i): i=1,...,N\}$, 

On the other side, slot filling is often treated as a sequence labeling task. 
We need to learn a mapping function that maps an input query sentence $\textbf{x}$ to the corresponding label sequence $\textbf{y}$, where $\textbf{y}=[y_{1}, ..., y_{n}]$ is the slot labels of each word.
% Here we also have a set of training examples $\{(\textbf{x}_i, \textbf{y}_i): i=1,...,N\}$, where $\textbf{x}_i=[x_{i1}, ..., x_{in_i}]$ is the input sentence with $n_i$ words, and $\textbf{y}_i=[y_{i1}, ..., y_{in_i}]$ is the slot label of each word. 

For example, Table \ref{atis_sample} shows a sample sentence in the ATIS dataset. Its intent is \emph{flight}, indicating the user wants flight-related information. We also need to identify the \emph{from\_city} and the \emph{to\_city} slots so that the we can return the correct information.

\subsection{Regular Expression Patterns}
\label{re_desc}
Regular expression patterns are commonly used in naturaly language related tasks. As for intent detection, an \RE typically models a textual pattern and output a related tag for the sentence when the pattern mathes. For example, a pattern 
\texttt{/\textasciicircum flights?\:from/} can match the sentence in Table \ref{atis_sample}, and output intent \emph{flight}. 


Similarly, in slot filling, given the group functionality of \RE, we can assign tags to our interested groups (the text surrounded by brackets). For example, \texttt{/from\:(\_\_CITY)\:to\:(\_\_CITY)/} will match the sentence in Tabel \ref{atis_sample}, and assign \emph{fromloc.city} to the first group, and \emph{toloc.city} to the second one. Here \emph{\_\_CITY} is a list of all the city names, which can be repalced with a string like \texttt{/boston|miami|LA/}. 
Note that, an ordinary word list pattern can be can be written as things like \texttt{/(\_\_CITY)/} in \RE.

When writing \RE patterns, since complicated \texttt{RE}s often leads to better performance but require more efforts to generate, pattern complexity is usually an important trade-off that we need to make. Generally, two aspects of \RE influence the complexity the most. First, pattern complexity increases with the number of groups in the \RE. This kind of complexity will lead to better precision and lower coverage. Second, pattern complexity also increases with the number of \emph{or}s (the symbol $|$) in a group. Here a group can be considered as a set of phrases that express the same meaning. Therefore this kind of complexity usually results in higher coverage and slightly lower precision.

Note that, while the outputs are the intent or slot themselves in the examples above, the \RE output can also be a tag related to, but not the same as, the label that we want to predict.
We allow this variation because using tags different from the target labels can sometimes make it easier to write an \RE. For example, we need \texttt{/from\:(\_\_CITY)/} to identify \emph{fromloc.city}, but only \texttt{/(\_\_CITY)/} to identify \emph{city}. In this paper, the output of intent patterns is the same as the intent label, and the output of slot patterns used by the method in Section \ref{interact_with_module} is the same as the slot label. However, the slot \RE tag for methods in Section \ref{fusion_with_input} and \ref{fusion_with_output} is the entity part of the slot label (e.g., \emph{city} in \emph{fromloc.city}).
