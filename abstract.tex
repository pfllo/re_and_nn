Combining neural networks (\NN) and human-generated rules is a promising way to lower the requirement for the amount of training data,
and can possibly produce better results than pure empirical methods. Specifically, we investigate the methods of combining \NN with
regular expression (\RE), which is one of the most commonly used rules in natural language processing. We experiment our method in intent
detection and slot filling settings with different amounts of training data, and the experimental results show that our methods give
clear boost to the baseline \NN model by combining with \RE. Besides, we also give systematical analysis on the working scenario of each
method, and on the influence of the complexity of the \RE as well.
