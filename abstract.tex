Combining neural network (\NN) and human-generated rules is a promising way to reduce the requirement for the amount of training data, and can possibly produce better results than pure empirical methods. Specifically, we investigate the methods to combine \NN with regular expressions (\RE), which is one of the most commonly used rules in the natural langue processing world. We experiment our method in natural language understanding settings with different numbers of training data, and the results show that our method gives clear boost to the baseline model by combining with \RE. Besides, we also give systematical analysis on the working scenario of each method, and on the influence of the complexity of the \RE as well.
